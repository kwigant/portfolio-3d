      "<p>I was born and raised in San Jose, California! I grew up in the heart of <strong>Silicon Valley</strong>, though I never thought I’d end up in tech. As a kid, I just wanted to be outside - not fiddling with the family computer.</p><p>But that all changed when I went to <strong>UC Santa Cruz</strong> and took a mandatory Python class. It was there something clicked and I discovered my passion for web and app development!</p><p>I didn’t realize at the time, but that class ended up being the turning point that set me on the path to becoming a <strong>Business Owner</strong> and <strong>UX engineer</strong>.</p>",

      "<p>I’m always brainstorming new ideas and seeking opportunities to create something meaningful.</p> <p> One of my proudest ventures was co-founding <a href='/projects/houseme'><strong>HouseMe Networks LLC</strong></a>, a start-up focused on providing rental solutions for college students. While we didn’t get to a full launch, the journey taught me invaluable skills in <strong>business management</strong>, <strong>marketing</strong>, <strong>research</strong>, and—of course—<strong>development</strong> and <strong>design</strong>.</p> <p> These experiences gave me the confidence to start my own freelance business: <a href='/?tab=contact'><strong>Kirsten Wigant Web Studio</strong></a>, where I now help clients bring their ideas to life through thoughtful design and development. I’m currently open to new projects — so if you’re looking for a creative partner, feel free to reach out!</p>",

      "<p>Becoming an engineer wasn't originally the plan—I didn't even start coding until my first year of college! But I love how development lets me turn ideas into reality.</p>  <p>After a few summers as a Business Analyst Intern, I landed a <strong>UX Engineer role at Cisco</strong>, where I’ve spent the last 5 years refining my skills in <a className='cta-link' href='/projects'><strong>full-stack rapid prototyping.</strong></a></p> <p>Most recently, I’ve worked with <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Angular</strong>, but I’m versatile and always eager to tackle new challenges! My peers often call me a <strong>'Jack of all trades'</strong> for how quickly I learn and contribute to any project.</p>",

      "<p>When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me getting creative in one way or another.</p> <p> I love <strong>exploring different art forms</strong>—gouache painting, ceramic tiles and pots, and more recently, digital art through pixel art and 3D modeling.</p> <p> My artistic side has always influenced the way I approach my work. Through a lot of self-teaching (thanks to <strong>online courses</strong> and <strong>personal projects</strong>), I’ve developed a strong eye for design. Working as a UX engineer, and now Freelance Web & Mobile Developer, has given me even more insight into how great design teams work and what makes a platform truly shine.</p>",
